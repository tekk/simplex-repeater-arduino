### Using cheap chinese 120s record module

Demonstration video:

[![Here's a video of it in action](https://img.youtube.com/vi/7L6kk_D51vU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L6kk_D51vU)

Please compile and run under [PlatformIO IDE](http://platformio.org/platformio-ide)

### Notes
- I've used older Arudino Mega1280 cause it was in my spare parts
- To upload to Mega2560 just uncomment it in `platformio.ini` file (I've already prepared the configuration)

### Dependent libraries
- Adafruit GFX Library
- Adafruit PCD8544 display driver
- Note that in PlatformIO these libs are in config file `platformio.ini` and should be downloaded automatically when compiled

#### TODO
- Schematic
